### Jackery Mini 3350mAh Portable Charger Mount

Updated 2019/04/03
 * Added battery_mount_opt.stl
 * Added chamfers for easier installation of the battery

I use it on my top tube bento box mount braze-ons. Should work on bottle cage mounts too.

Print 2 battery_mount.stl or 1 battery_mount.stl and 1 battery_mount_opt.stl. The button will be covered if you use battery_mount.stl on the end whith the button, though I am still able to activate the button by pressing on the mount's band where the button is. Use battery_mount_opt.stl if you want clear access to the button.
